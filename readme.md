## Prerequisites

To run this app locally or deploy it, you need to have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Streamlit**: A framework to create interactive web apps.
- **PyMuPDF (fitz)**: For PDF text extraction.
- **python-docx**: For Word document text extraction.
- **Google Generative AI**: For text analysis using Gemini API.

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit pymupdf python-docx google-generativeai
Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
2. API Key Setup
For the app to work with the Google Gemini API, you need an API key.

Option 1: Using Streamlit Secrets
Create a .streamlit directory in your project root folder if it doesn't exist.
Inside .streamlit, create a secrets.toml file.
Add your API key to secrets.toml:
toml
Copy code
[general]
api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
Streamlit will automatically load this API key when you deploy or run the app locally.

Option 2: Hardcoding API Key (Not Recommended)
Alternatively, you can directly replace the st.secrets["general"]["api_key"] in the app.py file with your API key, but this is not recommended for production or open-source apps due to security reasons.

Running the App Locally
Once the setup is complete, you can run the app locally by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will open a web interface in your browser, where you can upload your document and ask questions related to it.

How to Use the App
Upload a Document: Click on the file uploader and select either a PDF or Word document.
Preview Document: After the document is uploaded, the system will display a preview of the documentâ€™s content.
Ask Custom Questions: In the next section, enter your question regarding the document's content.
Generate Answer: Click the "Generate Answer" button to receive a response generated by the AI based on the document content.
Deployment
If you'd like to deploy this app online using Streamlit Cloud, follow these steps:

Sign up or log in to your Streamlit Cloud account: Streamlit Cloud.
Create a new app: Link your GitHub repository to deploy the app.
Add the API Key in Secrets: In your Streamlit Cloud app's settings, navigate to the Secrets section, and add your Gemini API key under [general].
Limitations
The app only supports PDF and Word documents.
Text extraction from the documents is done based on the available text, so any non-textual content (like images or tables) may not be processed.
